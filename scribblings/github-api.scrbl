@defmodule[github-api]
github-api is a wrapper for easily making requests to the GitHub api.

While this document contains usage examples, the functional tests found in the functional_tests directory of the @hyperlink["https://github.com/eu90h/racket-github-api"
                                                                                                                            "github repository"]
provide a good source of usage examples and patterns.

@section{Authentication & Initialization}
Before you begin making requests to the GitHub api, you must create an identity.

@defstruct[github-identity ([type symbol?] [data list?])]{
 This struct holds your GitHub identity.

 @racket[type] must be one of the following symbols: @racket['password 'personal-token 'oauth]
 
 @racket['password] authentication
 simply uses your GitHub username and password.

 @racket['personal-token] authentication allows you
 to send your GitHub username and a personal access token (created on your GitHub settings page.)

 @racket['oauth] uses an OAuth token for authorization.
 
 For more information, see the @(hyperlink "https://developer.github.com/v3/auth/#basic-authentication"
                                           "github api documentation")

 The @racket[data] field is a list whose contents are determined by user authentication method.

 For @racket['password] or @racket['personal-token] types,
 your data will be of the form @racket[(list username password-or-token)],
 where both @racket[username] & @racket[password-or-token] are strings.

 For @racket['oauth], the data will simply be @racket[(list oauth-token)], where @racket[oauth-token]
 is a string.
}
@defproc[(github-api [id github-identity?]
                     [#:endpoint endpoint string? "api.github.com"]
                     [#:user-agent user-agent string? "racket-github-api-@eu90h"])
         github-api-req/c]{
 Once you've created an identity, apply it to this procedure to receive a
 function for making api requests.
 
The optional @racket[#:endpoint] keyword sets the root endpoint for making api requests. If you have a GitHub enterprise
account, you may wish to change the endpoint. See @hyperlink["https://developer.github.com/v3/#root-endpoint"
                                                             "this"]
for more information on root-endpoints.

If you change the user-agent string, be aware that GitHub has certain rules explicated @hyperlink["https://developer.github.com/v3/#user-agent-required" "here"]}

@defstruct[github-response ([code number?] [data jsexpr?])]
This is the data structure returned as the result of making a GitHub API request. The @racket[code] field
holds the HTTP status code and @racket[data] holds the content of the response.
@defform[(github-api-req/c (-> string?
                               [#:method string?
                                #:data string?
                                #:media-type string?]
                               github-response?))]{
This is a contract for the procedures returned by the function @racket[github-api].
These functions are called with an api request and return a @racket[github-response] struct.

Typically, one would not use this procedure directly but rather pass it along to another function.

The @racket[#:method] keyword specifies what HTTP verb to use (I.e. "GET", "POST", "PATCH", etc.)

The @racket[#:data] keyword specifies any information to send along with the request. This is almost always
 a JSON string.

Finally, @racket[#:media-type] specifies the format in which you wish to receive data.
 Practically every @racket[github-*] procedure has an optional keyword @racket[#:media-type]
 that allows you to specify a media-type for a request.
 
 For more information on media types
see @hyperlink["https://developer.github.com/v3/media/" "the GitHub api documentation"].

@section{A Note on Identity Security}
According to the GitHub documentation, personal access tokens are equivalent to your password. Never
give it out (and don't accidently commit your identity!)

Read more about your options for authentication @hyperlink["https://developer.github.com/v3/#authentication"
                                                           "here"]


@section{Example}
@racketblock[
 (define personal-token "fs52knf535djbfk2je43b2436")
 (define username "alice")
 (define id (github-identity 'personal-token (list username personal-token)))
 
 (define github (github-api id))
 (github "/users/plt/repos")
 ]
Here we make a request to get the repositories created by the user plt.
@section{Working with JSON Data}
When making requests to the GitHub API, it is common to receive data encoded in the
JSON format. This quick section introduces Racket's JSON handling facilities.

Racket provides a library for working with JSON data, aptly called @racket[json].

This is used by the Racket github-api library to encode data before returning it.

Essentially, JSON expressions are represented as hashes. The JSON object
@racketblock[
             { "name": "billy bob" }
             ]
becomes the hash
@racketblock[
            (define jsexpr (make-hash (list (cons 'name "billy bob"))))
             ]
To get the value associated with the key 'name, use @racket[hash-ref] like so:
@racketblock[
             (hash-ref jsexpr 'name)
             ]
which should return @racket["billy bob"]

To learn more about working with hashes see the @hyperlink["http://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/hash-tables.html"
                                                           "Racket guide"]
and the @hyperlink["http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/hashtables.html"
                   "Racket reference"] on hash-tables.

@section{Gist API}
The Gist API will return up to 1 megabyte of content from a requested gist.

To see if a file was truncated,
check whether or not the key @racket[truncated] is @racket["true"].

To get the full contents of the file,
make a request to the url referenced by the key @racket[raw_url].

For more information on truncation see the @hyperlink["https://developer.github.com/v3/gists/#truncation"
                                                                                                          "GitHub documentation"]

Creates a gist containing files given as a list of pairs @racket[(filename contents)].
 If the gist was created successfully, a @racket[jsexpr?] is returned.

The optional keyword @racket[description] provides a description of the gist. By default it is empty.

The optional keyword @racket[public] determines whether or not the gist is public. By default this is @racket[#f].

@section{Webhooks & Service Hooks}
Webhooks are a sort-of user defined callback in the form of a listening webserver that github sends a
message to whenever a certain type of event occurs.

A service hook is a webhook whose type is anything except @racket["web"]

To read more, see the @hyperlink["https://developer.github.com/webhooks/"
                                 "GitHub documentation"]

                           [type string?]

                           [#:active active boolean? #t])
         github-response?]
The @racket[type] parameter must be the string @racket["web"] or a service name defined in @hyperlink["https://api.github.com/hooks"
                                                                                                      "this"] rather inconvenient JSON file.

Passing any other string results in an error response from the GitHub API.

Note: The @racket[type] parameter is referred to in the GitHub documentation (misleadingly, I think) as the
name of the webhook.
